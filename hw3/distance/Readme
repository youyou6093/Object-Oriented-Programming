1.distance.cpp:16:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'miles'; did you mean
      'pmiles'?
    miles+=increase;
    ^~~~~
    pmiles
./distance.h:13:9: note: 'pmiles' declared here
    int pmiles;

solution: change miles to pmiles, which is the private data of my class
        ^

distance.cpp:63:40: warning: missing terminating
      ' character [-Winvalid-pp-token]

solution:use raw output,’\’’ instead of ‘’’.


3.distance.cpp:83:21: error: use of undeclared identifier 'check'
    if((c!=',') || (check(d.pmiles,d.pyards,d.pfeet,d.pinches)==0)){
                    ^
1 error generated.

solution:forgot to declare check function in the distance.h.

bool operator==(const Distance &d1,const Distance &d2){


solution: can’t change the member data of a const object. Actually this is a typo, change’=‘ to ‘==‘ fix it.



5.distance.cpp:209:12: error: non-const lvalue reference to type 'Distance' cannot
      bind to a temporary of type 'Distance *'
    return this;                 ^

solution: the return type of the function is Distance&, so I should return *this, not this.


6.Something more about my class, multiplication function can’t take in a very big int,because int times the yards/inches/feet might overflow.

The biggest value of yards is 1759 yards, so the int number take into the multiplication function cannot be bigger than maximum 32 bit integer divide 1759.
