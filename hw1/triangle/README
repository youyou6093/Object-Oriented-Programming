Errors:


1.”cannot define the implicit copy assignment operator for 'Triangle', because non-static const member 'MAX_SIZE' cannot use copy assignment operator”

solution: I should add static before the constant min_size and max_size, so that it’s the same for all the triangle class.



2.”Makefile:2: *** missing separator.  Stop.”

solution: I am using Xcode, so whenever I type tab, it use 4 space instead, change the makefile editor to a normal text editor fix the problem.


3.”./triangle.h:21:2: error: expected ';' after class”

solution:Add a ‘;’ after the end of class.

4.”triangle.cpp:25:12: error: use of undeclared identifier 'sqrt’”

solution: Forgot to include Cmath into library.

5.”triangle.cpp:81:29: error: use of undeclared identifier 'setprecision’”

solution: in order to use format output, I have to use iomanip library. 


6.Forgot to link the “triangle.cpp” and “triangle.h” in make file.

7.I cannot call the private data outside of the class.

8.”triangle.cpp:51:13: error: assigning to 'char' from incompatible type
      'const char [2]’”

  solution: I should use ’’ for char,not “”

9. When I writing member function in triangle class, I need to type “Triangle::” before the function.

10.I shouldn’t using ‘,’ in side of for loop.I should using ‘;’.
