1.Error: myint.cpp:415:12: error: non-const lvalue reference to type 'MyInt' cannot bind
      to a temporary of type 'MyInt *'
    return this;
           ^~~~
solution: instead of return this, I should return *this


2.Error: myint.cpp:419:15: error: return type of out-of-line definition of
      'MyInt::operator++' differs from that in the declaration
MyInt& MyInt::operator++(int){
~~~~~~        ^
./myint.h:33:11: note: previous declaration is here
    MyInt operator++(int);        //postfix
    ~~~~~ ^
myint.cpp:422:12: warning: reference to stack memory associated with local
      variable 'copy' returned [-Wreturn-stack-address]
    return copy;
           ^~~~
solution: for post fix increment, the return type should be R value.

3.Error: segmentation fault 11.

solution: for the grow function, I have to check whether the object is empty or not!

4.False result for addition.

solution: I forgot to increase the length of the character after the final steps, so if there are any increment on the most signifiant digits, it will give the wrong answer.

5. Error: myint.cpp:103:1: error: 'friend' used outside of class
friend bool operator< (const MyInt& x, const MyInt& y){
^
1 error generated.

solution: should not use friend keyword out of myint class.
