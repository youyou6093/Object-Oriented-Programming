1. main.cpp:8:17: error: call to constructor of 'Temperature' is ambiguous
    Temperature t1;
                ^
./temperature.h:15:5: note: candidate constructor
    Temperature();
    ^
./temperature.h:16:5: note: candidate constructor
    Temperature(double a=0,char b='c');
    ^

  Solution:change Temperature(double a=0,char b=‘c’) to Temperature(double a,char b)

   

2.temperature.cpp:68:25: error: member function 'Convert' not viable: 'this'
      argument has type 'const Temperature', but function is not marked const
    double calling_in_k=d.Convert('k');

  Solution:don’t call a function that is not marked as const in a const member
        function.


3.temperature.cpp:44:9: error: use of undeclared identifier 'degrees_in_k'; did
      you mean 'degrees_k'?
        degrees_in_k=convert_to_k(degrees,scale);


   Solution:this is a typo, I should use degrees_k, which is the private data I 	
    declared.

4.temperature.cpp:53:19: error: use of undeclared identifier 'scale'
        case 'D': format=f; return 1;

 Solution: I forget to add “Temperature::” before the SetFormat Function.

5../temperature.h:8:17: error: non-const static data member must be initialized
      out of line
    static char format='D';
                ^      ~~~
Solution:Initialize format in this way:”char Temperature::format=‘D’;”
