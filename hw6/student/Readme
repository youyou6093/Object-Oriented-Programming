Problems: 

1. main.cpp:242:9: warning: delete called on 'Student' that is abstract but has
      non-virtual destructor [-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor]
        delete something[i];

solution: add a virtual before ~Student();

2. no function called atoi().

solution: I shouldâ€™t use a function from STL library. Instead, write a function myself to convert string to int.

3.  No  matching function for ifstream file(string).

solution: Instead of using string as a parameter, using cstring.

change input to input.c_str();

4.main.cpp:141:15: error: cannot initialize a variable of type 'Student *' with an
      rvalue of type 'Student **'
    Student * something = new Student *[n];
              ^           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

solution: change Student * something to Student ** something

5.main.cpp:177:29: error: member reference type 'Student *' is a pointer; did you
      mean to use '->'?
                something[i].Output(of);
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~^
                            ->

solution: use something[i]->Output(of).
